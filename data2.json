        "Hey, yep I''m the owner of the server and the person that warned/banned you. First of all, just off the bat, not going to unban you unless there are some insanely extenuating circumstances, which I can almost guarantee that there won''t be- if that''s enough for you, feel free to leave, nobody''s gonna stop you\n\nWith that out of the way, to explain what I did: I warned you a couple of times after discovering different things that you''d stolen on multiple occasions. Initially I gave you a third and final chance, which I''d say was pretty generous to even let you get that far, especially considering that I knew absolutely nothing other than basically knowing somebody that I also know. I host this server for free for anybody whitelisted, using a computer, wifi, processing power, etc. that I''ve paid for, not to mention the hours that I''ve put into setting up the server and keeping it running for people like you. You have literally contributed nothing to the server other than making others'' experiences marginally worse, so I''d consider it generous that I, for one, let you in and allowed you to play, and two, didn''t just ban you after the first sign that you were leeching. That being said, I instead decided to just ban you after I found your base and saw the sheer magnitude of stolen things; initially it just seemed like small things but I realised that you''d taken pretty significant/unique items.\n\nNot that the amount of items really matters in retrospect, honestly it''s just telling of the type of person you are- you saw no problem with making other people''s days worse because it''d make you feel better, and you''re only now doing anything since you were caught. I know full well that you wouldn''t have done a thing about fixing what you did if you weren''t caught red-handed, and honestly you still aren''t, you haven''t apologised for your actions and instead have tried to pass the blame onto me for being too uptight I guess? Again, very telling of the type of person you are- you physically cannot take responsibility for your own actions and mistakes. Anyway, you''re not 4 years old, you know that stealing is wrong and that people don''t like it, don''t try to pull the \"I didn''t know\" card.\n\nAlso, the emeralds that you stole are 100% legitimately obtained- I haven''t spawned in any, they''ve been made through trading farms and emerald farms, both of which many people have on the server. You also stole Toxic''s shield, which was exclusively and uniquely made by him, for him. Nothing about it would tell you that it was spawned in, because, well, it wasn''t. Just an example of course, and it doesn''t matter if things were spawned in or not anyway, you took things that weren''t yours, which is objectively wrong and again, very telling of your character and maturity. We both know that this part of your argument was just tacked on after the face to try and provide a flimsy reason for your actions, but figured I''d refute it just in case you thought you were somehow justified through it.\n\nI know that you''re probably young or at the very least just immature, but do your best to look inward to see what you could change about yourself- you''ve acted selfishly and without any regard for others'' property, feelings, etc. You''ve also shown that you struggle to accept that your actions were wrong, and you''re most likely lying to yourself or maybe just putting on an act to try and serve yourself yet again. I wouldn''t be typing out a whole essay if this were only a game, which obviously Minecraft is, but your actions and personality flaws are very real and absolutely will hurt you and others in the future (and in more serious ways) if you don''t put in effort to fix them now.\n\nIf you get angry about this message rather than accepting that you did something wrong after it''s all laid out for you, that''s a great sign that you probably need to change some things. I''m happy to help, and honestly am not mad at you or hate you, etc, but I felt obligated to lay this out.",
