# machine-learning-project

This respository is just proof of my own machine-learning algorithm.

The goal of this program was to automatically reply to my friend in the same way that him and I usually conversate.
I used tensorflow keras to train my model and wrote the model into an intents file.
Then implemented SQL Query to read the latest incoming message from my friend and used NLTK to analyze the text message.
The model would classify his text and respond automatically using osascript (applescript) according to what the message is tagged as.
