Initially I gave you a third and final chance, which I''d say was pretty generous to even let you get that far, especially considering that I knew absolutely nothing other than basically knowing somebody that I also know. I host this server for free for anybody whitelisted, using a computer, wifi, processing power, etc. that I''ve paid for, not to mention the hours that I''ve put into setting up the server and keeping it running for people like you. You have literally contributed nothing to the server other than making others'' experiences marginally worse, so I''d consider it generous that I, for one, let you in and allowed you to play, and two, didn''t just ban you after the first sign that you were leeching. That being said, I instead decided to just ban you after I found your base and saw the sheer magnitude of stolen things; initially it just seemed like small things but I realised that you''d taken pretty significant/unique items.",
